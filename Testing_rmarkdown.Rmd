## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## How I fixed errors

As I used the R Markdown for the first time, there were a few errors.

- **Cannot create pdf**  
Sol) [ref: RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/t/r-studio-is-not-recognizing-miktex-download/30665/4)  
```{r}
#install.packages('tinytex')
#tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

- *Warning messages were shown*  
Ex) Warning message: In has_crop_tools() : Tool(s) not installed or not in PATH: pdfcrop, ghostcript -> As a result, figure cropping will be disabled.  
  
  Sol) [ref: stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66305776/got-knit-issue-with-r)  
  Control Panel-> System and Security -> System -> In advanced tab, click "environment variables". -> Click new and type "C:\\Program Files\\gs\\gs9.54.0\\bin\\gswin64.exe" or whatever your current version -> Validate. Done.
